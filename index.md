Hi!
I'm an aspiring mathematical analyst and PhD student at Stanford, where I am generously supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, where I completed the honors degree program under the supervision of [Gautam Iyer](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~gautam/sj/index.html).
As an undergraduate, I also worked with [Ian Tice](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~iantice/index.html) on various problems in fluids and with [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/) on problems in discrete differential geometry as a member of the [Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/).

Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the field of "applied analysis"-that is, the application of analytical tools and ideas to other branches of mathematics and computer science, ranging from differential geometry and the calculus of variations to geometry processing and computer graphics.

This site exists both in the hopes that someone will find the content here useful and to serve as some sort of documentation for myself; hopefully both of those goals are achieved to some extent.

Here's a short list of some stuff I've done:

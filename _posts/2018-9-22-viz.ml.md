# About
Last weekend, I participated in [HackCMU 2018](http://hackcmu.org/), a beginner-oriented hackathon hosted at CMU.
Although I have mixed thoughts on the event itself, today I'll be focusing on my project for it, [viz.ml](https://github.com/TheNumbat/viz.ml), which I worked on with my roommate, [Max Slater](https://thenumbat.github.io/).
Largely based off of [this blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/), our project aimed to provide similar visualizations and interactivity for both the original MNIST dataset and [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), with potential extensions to similar datasets. 
To reuse our tagline from the project submission itself, we built "a custom gpu-based interactive dimensionality reduction visualization engine in C++ for introspection of high dimensional big data sets from machine learning," although that title isn't completely meant to be taken seriously.
Did we hit this goal? Well, let's see...

# Tech Stack
To start off, the libraries we used and incorporated into the project were as follows:
- Visualization/Interactivity: Custom OpenGL shaders. 
- UI: DearImgui.
- Optimization: [NLOpt](https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt).
- [Various](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE) [Modified versions](https://github.com/CannyLab/tsne-cuda) of the [C++ Barnes-Hut t-SNE library](https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne).
- Custom VC++ build engine.

# Algorithm Implementation: Not Quite Real Time

Mirroring the blog post linked above, we aimed primarily to provide implementations of three different dimensionality reduction algorithms: MDS, Sammon's mapping, and Barnes-Hut tSNE. 
Undoubtedly, BH-tSNE was the most complicated of these algorithms, but ironically, it was the one we ultimately found easiest to implement, with C++ implementations already available that performed both the Barnes Hut BVH acceleration as well as tSNE itself. 
Somehow, MDS and Sammon's mapping proved to be the more difficult of the algorithms to work with.
In theory, both of these mappings were simple minimizations of objective functions, for which any gradient descent method should've sufficed. 
For whatever reason, however, we failed to converge even on small toy examples with the built in NLOpt algorithms, even those that were gradient free.
Even with significantly simpler functions, convergence failed, and we think this may be partially due to some specifics of our build environment, as we didn't seem to have the same issues with simple test functions on an Ubuntu VM, though this requires further investigation.

Consequently, we only  ended up shipping per-pixel visualization and BH-tSNE.
Furthermore, since runtime for BH-tSNE still ended up being fairly long, though an implementation is in the repo, we pre-calcd the result of the optimizations in the actual demo.

# UI/Interactivity
The UI/visualization was mainly implemented by Max, so I won't be focusing too much on implementation details here.
Rather, I'll just take quite note of the various features available, which we basically consider to be feature complete.

- Dynamic loading of thumbnail data on hover
- Basic 3D Camera interactivity: Zoom, panning, etc.
- Real-time adjustment of dataset/visualization

# Future Improvements
As mentioned, we're pretty happy with the UI/interactivity as is, so if we were to continue work on this, most effort would probably be put towards the optimization/data side of the project. In particular, getting NLOpt to work would be nice, particularly if we could get that optimization to work in real time (with visualizations of the optimization procedure itself).  
Beyond that, adding in functionality to extend our project to other datasets arbitrarily shouldn't be too difficult, but obviously would be a nice direction to head towards. 
Overall though, this was definitely a neat project and an interesting way to exploring the existing literature on dimensionality reduction; thanks for your time!

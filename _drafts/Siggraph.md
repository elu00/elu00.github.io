excerpt: "Some combination of thoughts and recap on attending the conference"
---
This year, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to attend [Siggraph 2019](https://s2019.siggraph.org/) as a member of the [Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/) at CMU.
Overall, it was a really entertaining and enlightening experience and so, in an attempt to make some account of everything that went on, I'll be attempting to summarize my experiences within this post. 

I will take some time to note, however, that my overall experience within geometry processing is very limited, so my general impressions of the technical papers that I'll be sharing at **at best** general impressions. Additionally, although most of the event titles here should *hopefully* be specific enough as to facilitate easy Googling, I'll be attempting to fill in this post with relevant links/photos/etc., although my past history in updating stuff hasn't been so great. 

# Day 1 (7/28)
## Demoscene Underground
A pretty standard but nevertheless interesting demo show.
Starting out with a couple demos promoting Siggraph Asia, this session moved on to  

## Technical Papers Fast Forward
A two-hour block in which each technical paper is given 30 seconds to sell itself and its related talk.
Although I heard of several behind-the-scenes issues from the different authors I talked to, as a spectator, the whole presentation did a pretty good job of conveying all the neat ideas presented within the conference.
The only thing that was a bit unusual was how several authors opted to exclusively use text-to-speech for their narration.
Although a language barrier certainly  
Additionally,  

# Day 2 (7/29)

## Advances in Real-Time Rendering in Games (Part 2)
A sort of hybrid between talk and course, this course aimed to draw attention to a lot of the more subtle effects 

## The Making of Avengers: Endgame
Interestingly enough, this 

## Electronic Theater
Hosted at the Microsoft Theatre, and apparently a qualifier for the 

## Reception
Within the 

# Day 3 (7/30)

## Technical Papers Session: Meshing

### Parameterization Quantization with Free Boundaries for Quad Meshing

### TriWild: Robust Triangulation with Curve Constraints
While interestingly not

### Harmonic Triangulations

### Navigating Intrinsic Triangulations 

## The Making of Toy Story 4
Naturally focusing on the graphics side of Toy Story production, this 

## Technical Papers Session: Deformation and FEM

## Real-time Live
Although hyped up as part of the same general program as the Electronic Theater and the VR Theater, I personally found this person to be kind of disappointing. The majority of the presentations effectively came off as ads for this project or another

# Day 4 (7/31)

## Technical Papers Session: Transport: Parallel and Optimal
Although 
### Symmetric Moving Frames
### Optimal Transport-Based Polar Interpolation of Directional Fields
### The Vector Heat Method
## VR Theater

## Geometric Algebra for Computer Graphics
A really neat 

## Technical Papers Session: Maps and Operators

# Day 5 (8/1)
## Job Fair

## Emerging Technologies/Experience Theater
Located in the same hall as the job fair,  

## Technical Papers: MPM and Collision/Fluids II

## The Making of Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse
A session detailing all the difference nuances and subtle tricks put into the production of Into the Spiderverse.

Both because it

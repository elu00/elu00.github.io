# About
Time for my annual post on this site I guess?

Over the past couple weeks, I've been attempting to setup the [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/) alongside [KDE](https://kde.org/) on my laptop as a way to leverage both the aesthetics and productivity of a tiling WM and the convenience provided by a full DE (i.e., easy application scaling for high DPI screens, easy out-of-the-box network configuration, and the settings daemon provided by KDE).
Surprisingly though, actually getting everything ***fully*** functional has turned out to be pretty difficult, so I'm making this post to collect the various fixes I found along the way, most of which are sourced from a [variety of other sources](#other-resources) I've found.

Unlike just a plain dotfiles repo or anything like that though, I'll try to keep this post as unopinionated as possible; hopefully that'll lead to it being somewhat easy to adapt.

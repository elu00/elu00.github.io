Much of the content of this post is based off content from 21-242 at CMU as taught by [Clinton Conley](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~clintonc/).
Consequently, I claim no credit for any of the ideas presented below, but (as explained previously), I think that the following results are really neat and worth sharing.  
This is also a continuation of [a previous post]({% link _posts/2019-6-3-markov-pt1.md %}), so I'll be referring back to various results and ideas from it.

# Motivation
Last time, we proved a neat consequence of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the 
Today, we'll see how we can leverage the same key insight we use last time to prove a variety of other
